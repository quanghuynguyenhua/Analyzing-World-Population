# Analyzing World Population

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to the fascinating project of analyzing global population data sourced from the CIA World Factbook. In this project, we delve into the vast realm of demographic statistics, population growth, and the intriguing nuances that shape our world.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The world's population is a dynamic entity, and understanding its intricacies is vital for a range of fields, from economics to public health, and beyond. The CIA World Factbook provides a wealth of information on countries and regions, including detailed population data. Our project seeks to leverage this valuable resource to gain insights into global population trends and disparities.

In this SQL project, I will use the dataset by CIA World Factbook, year 2022 and explore how the world population spreads across different countries.

This project will answer some following analytical questions:

1. Which country has the highest population?

2. Which country has the least number of people?

3. Which country is witnessing the highest population growth?

4. Which country has an extraordinary number for the population?

5. Which is the most densely populated country in the world?

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Please use [this link](https://public.tableau.com/views/world-population_16992891538170/WorldPopulation?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to view the dashboard, posted on Tableau public.

### References

Data is sourced from:
[CIA World Factbook 2022](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2022/references/guide-to-country-comparisons/)

Dataset: The dataset contains 12 columns and 226 rows. It has the following variables:

* name - name of a country.

* area - total area of the country (area_water + area_land).

* region - continent region of a country

* population - population of the country.

* population_growth_rate - the ratio of the population growth in 2015.

* birth_rate - the rate at which people are born in a country.

* death_rate - the rate at which people die in a country.

* GDP - gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year

* median_age - median age of a country

* migration_rate - the ratio of people that left one country to another.

The data from the CIA World Factbook is rich but often comes with inconsistencies and complexities that require careful cleaning and transformation. This is where Tableau Prep Builder enters the scene. With its powerful data preparation capabilities, I meticulously cleanse and shape the raw data, ensuring accuracy and consistency. From handling missing values to standardizing formats, our goal is to make the dataset ready for the visualization process.

Once data is cleaned and structured, It will be transition to the visualization phase using Tableau Desktop. Here, I aim to create stunning, interactive visualizations that not only showcase the raw numbers but also tell compelling stories about population trends and dynamics around the world. Through maps, charts, and dashboards, I'll explore questions about population growth rates, distribution, age demographics, and much more.

The visualizations will provide a deep understanding of global population trends, enabling us to draw insightful conclusions and identify patterns that might otherwise remain hidden in the raw data.
